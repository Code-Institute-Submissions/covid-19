# COVID-19

Given the times we are living now i thought to build this website to help people with info about this pandemic!


 I present this for my first *milestone project* at the **CODE INSTITUTE**

## Demo 

 You can find it [here](https://mihai-busuioc.github.io/covid-19/) !

## UX

As a user i need this website to tell me as much as posible in generic information about the new coronavirus,

i would also find out more as soon as info become available so i subscribe to a newsletter  !

You can see my wireframe [here](assets/wireframe/Covid-frame-desk.pdf) and [here](assets/wireframe/Covid-frame-mobile.pdf) 

## Technologies

It's written in:
1. HTML
2. CSS 
3. BOOTSTRAP 4.41

## Features 

On the mobile site i made the menu colapse to save space, 

also a mid page modal to subscribe and get some news withowt the need to change the page 

## Testing 

All outside links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"' . All links have been 

manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.



This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile 
devices (iPhone x, 11 Pro: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung note 10 and note 10+) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. 


## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.
