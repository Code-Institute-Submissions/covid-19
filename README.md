# Hello 

# This is my first website!


## I present this for my first *milestone project* at the **CODE INSTITUTE**!

It's written in:
1. html 
2. css 
3. javascript through bootstrap

   I took all the info from the Official Websites https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 
   
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019 and i used pictures modified by me whith **Paint from Windows**
 
   The graphs are made by me with Excel and exported in pdf then print screen and modify in Paint

## I hope you like it !
